# Assignment 1 : Gimme the list of all the students that have passed in a class with proper grading system.
#               e.g. if a student has 3 subjects : Math / Physics / Chemistry
#                    if he scores less than 50 % in two of those subjects he fails over all
#                    however if he fails in only 1 subject then he fails in just 1 subject, that should be considered 
#                    as re appear
# 
#               Expectations : 
#                           1. Get a list of students failing in more than 2 or more subjects i.e. overall performance of class
#                           2. Get a list of students failing in 1 subject only - i.e. re appearing student
#                           3. Calculate the overall class performance based on students passed - point #1
#                           4. Calculate the overall performance based on grading system, to showcase the %age of
#                              students falling under 
#                                       a. Distinction - 80 % 
#                                       b. First Division - 60 - 79 % 
#                                       c. Second Division - 50 - 59 %
